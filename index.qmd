We're a bi-weekly open coding café for anyone working at Steno Aarhus (SDCA), Dept. of Endocrinology (HoK), AU-Public Health, AU-Clinical Medicine and AU-Biomedicine to come and get help with their code.

## Format

Below are the planned dates; you can arrive and leave at any time. There will be a ~15 minute presentation at the beginning, tackling a relevant topic (a general R concept, specific packages and workflows that are nice to know, etc.)

Subsequently, 1-2 experienced instructors will help with your specific challenges and questions. But pelase interact with each other—maybe there is someone in the group that has the solution to your problem.

## Prerequisites

You should have had some type of introduction to R; consider 

- a course such as <a href="https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/">this</a> offered by the Danish Diabetes and Endocrinology Academy
- an online course such as <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r">this one at Datacamp.com</a>
- the fantastic online book <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro.html">R for Data Science</a>

```{r}
#| echo: false

              rows = Date == min(Date[Date >= lubridate::today()])
            )
  )

```

### Other planned themes are:

- Nice to know packages (e.g., {gtsummary}, {Epi}, and {Hmisc})
- Matching and Weighting (using {MatchIt} and {WeightIt} packages)
- Missing data: different options and packages for it, including combining {mice} with {MatchThem}/{WeightThem}
- Preregistration as a means to improved workflows in R

Reach out to me if you want anything added to the list.
