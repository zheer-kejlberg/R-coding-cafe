    "text": "Things to do before asking for help\nBeing a good coder in R does not necessarily mean that one just sits down and writes a lot of code like writing a piece of text. Even experienced R users search online for code. The great thing about R is that there is often multiple solutions to a coding problem. What often separates an experienced user from a new user is that the experienced user know what to search for, where to search and understand the replies. We suggest that you try to search on either Google or directly in Stackoverflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI-tools\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a next step, it can be useful to use AI-tools like ChatGPT; however, beware that it can make up functions, and that it does not always work.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking a clear coding question\nSome issues are simple such as I cannot download this package. Other times what you want to do is more complex and needs a bit of background for a person outside your project to understand what you want to do. Therefore, you need to prepare and provide the context to the person you are asking for help. This could be in the form of showing the structure of your dataset, which functions you used, and what you have tried so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimal, reproducible examples\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first lesson in the coding café is specifically about preparing a good question (read about Minimal, Reproducible Examples).\n\n\n\n\n\nNote about sensitive data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are working on DST\n\n\n\n\n\nyou are not allowed to show the data to anyone else!\n\n\n\nYou may need to prepare your question a bit more. We recommend that you find an example dataset that looks similar to the dataset you work with and write down a coding example."

    "text": "Welcome to the Coding Café at the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA).\nWe’re a bi-weekly open “café” for anyone working at SDCA, Aarhus University Hospital, Department of Public Health, Department of Clinical Medicine and Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University to go and get assistance with coding in R. The only prerequisite so far is that you have had some type of introduction to R, preferably through a course such as this offered by the Danish Diabetes and Endocrinology Academy or similar introductory courses.\nThe sessions are open and anyone can join in and out at anytime during the allotted time. There will be a 10-15 minue presentation at the beginning, tackling a concept in R or specific packages and workflows that are nice to know, and 1-2 experience instructors will subsequently help with specific challenges and questions. We also highly encourage the participants to interact with each other - maybe there is someone in the group that has the solution to your problem."
